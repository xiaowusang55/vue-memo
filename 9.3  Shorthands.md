# Shorthands

The `v-` prefix serves as a visual cue for identifying **Vue-specific** attributes in your templates. This is useful when you are using **Vue.js** to apply dynamic behavior to some existing markup, but can feel **verbose** for some frequently used directives. At the same time, the need for the `v-` prefix becomes less important when you are building a **SPA**, where Vue manages every template. Therefore, Vue provides special shorthands for two of the most often used directives, `v-bind` and `v-on`:

## v-bind Shorthand

```html
    <!-- full syntax -->
    <a v-bind:href="url">...</a>

    <!-- shorthand -->
    <a :href="url">...</a>

    <!-- shorthand with dynamic argument(2.6.0+) -->
    <a :[key]="url">...</a>

```

## v-on Shorthand

```html
    <!-- full syntax -->
    <a v-on:click="soSomething">...</a>

    <!-- shorthand -->
    <a @click="doSomething">...</a>

    <!-- shorthand with dynamic argument(2.6.0+) -->
    <a @[event]="doSomething">...</a>
```

>They may look a bit different from normal HTML, but **`:`** and **`@`** are valid characters for attribute names and all Vue-supported browsers can parse it correctly. In addition, they do not appear in the final rendered markup. The shorthand syntax is totally optional, but you will likely appreciate it when you learn more about its usage later.
