    /*
    
    The most basic form of data binding is text interpolation using the “Mustache” syntax (double curly braces):
        <span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>

    The mustache tag will be replaced with the value of the msg property on the corresponding data object.
    It will also be updated whenever the data object’s msg property changes.

    You can also perform one-time interpolations that do not update on data change by using the
    v-once directive, but keep in mind this will also affect any other bindings on the same node:
        <span v-once>This will never change: {{ msg }}</span>
