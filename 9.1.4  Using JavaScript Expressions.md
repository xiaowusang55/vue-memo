# Using JavaScript Expressions

So far weâ€™ve only been binding to simple property keys in our templates. But Vue.js actually supports the full power of JavaScript expressions inside all data bindings:

```html
    {{ number + 1 }}

    {{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}

    {{ messsge.split('').reverse().join('') }}

    <div v-bind:id="'list-' + id"></div>
```

These expressions will be evaluated as JavaScript in the data scope of the owner Vue instance. One restriction is that each binding can only contain one single expression, so the following will NOT work:

```html
    <!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->
    {{ var a = 1 }}

    <!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->
    {{ if(ok) { return message } }}
```

>Template expressions are sandboxed and only have access to a whitelist of globals such as Math and Date. You should not attempt to access user defined globals in template expressions.
