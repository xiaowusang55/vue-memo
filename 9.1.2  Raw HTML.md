# Raw HTMl

The double mustaches interprets the data as plain text, not HTML. In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the v-html directive:

```html
<p>Using mustaches: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p
```

```js
new Vue({
    el: '.app',
    data: {
        rawHtml: '<span style="color:red">This should be red.</span>'
    }
})
```

* The contents of the `span` will be replaced with the value of the `rawHtml` property,
interpreted as plain HTML - data bindings are ignored.
* Note that you cannot use `v-html` to compose template partials, because **Vue** is not a string-based templating engine.

>Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous
because it can easily lead to **XSS vulnerabilities**. Only use HTML interpolation on
trusted content and never on user-provided content.
