# Directives

**Directives are special attributes with the v- prefix.**

- Directive attribute values are expected to be a **single JavaScript expression**(with the exception of v-for, which will be discussed later).
- A directive’s job is to reactively apply side effects to the DOM when the value of its expression changes.

 Let’s review the example we saw in the introduction:

```html
    <p v-if="seen">Now you see me</p>
```

Here, the `v-if` directive would remove/insert the `<p>` element based on the **truthiness** of the value of the expression seen.

## Arguments

Some directives can take an “argument”, denoted by a colon after the directive name.

- For example, the `v-bind` directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:

```html
    <a v-bind:href="url">...</a>
```

Here `href` is the argument, which tells the `v-bind` directive to bind the element’s `href` attribute to the value of the expression url.

- Another example is the `v-on` directive, which listens to DOM events:

```html
    <a v-on:click="doSomething">...</a>
```

Here the argument is the event name to listen to. We will talk about event handling in more detail too.

## Dynamic Arguments

***New in 2.6.0+***

Starting in version 2.6.0, it is also possible to use a JavaScript expression in a directive argument by wrapping it with square brackets:

```html
    <!-- Note that there are some constraints to the argument expression, as explained
        in the "Dynamic Argument Expression Constraints" section below. 
    -->
    <a v-bind:[attributeName]="url">...</a>
```

Here attributeName will be dynamically evaluated as a JavaScript expression, and its evaluated value will be used as the final value for the argument. For example, if your Vue instance has a data property, `attributeName`, whose value is `"href"`, then this binding will be equivalent to `v-bind:href`.

Similarly, you can use dynamic arguments to **bind a handler** to a **dynamic event name**:

```html
    <a v-bind:[eventName]="doSomething">...</a>
```

In this example, when `eventName`‘s value is `"focus",` `v-on:[eventName]` will be equivalent to `v-on:focus`.

### Dynamic Argument Value Constraints

>Dynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a **`string`**, with the exception of **`null`**. The special value null can be used to explicitly **remove the binding**. Any other **non-string value** will trigger a warning.

### Dynamic Argument Expression Constraints

>Dynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:

```html
    <!-- This will trigger a compiler warning. -->
    <a v-bind:['foo' + bar ]="value">...</a>
```

The workaround is to either use expressions without spaces or quotes, or replace the complex expression with a computed property.

When using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase characters, as browsers will coerce attribute names into lowercase:

```html
    <!-- 
        This will be converted to v-bind:[someattr] in in-DOM templates.
        Unless you have a "someattr" property in your instance, your code won't work.
     -->
     <a v-bind:[someAttr]="value">...</a>
```

### Modifiers

Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the `.prevent` modifier tells the `v-on` directive to call event`.preventDefault()` on the triggered event:

```html
    <form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
```

You’ll see other examples of modifiers later, for `v-on` and for `v-model`, when we explore those features.
