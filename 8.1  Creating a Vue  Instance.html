    /*
    Although not strictly associated with the MVVM pattern, Vue’s design was partly inspired by it. 
    As a convention, we often use the variable vm (short for ViewModel) to refer to our Vue instance.

    When you create a Vue instance, you pass in an options object. 
    The majority of this guide describes how you can use these options to create your desired behavior. 

    A Vue application consists of a root Vue instance created with new Vue, 
    optionally organized into a tree of nested, reusable components. 
    For example, a todo app’s component tree might look like this:

        Root Instance
        ----TodoList
        --------TosoItem
        -----------DeleteTodoButton
        -----------EditTodoButton
        ---------TodoListFooter
        -----------ClearTodosButton
        -----------TodoListStatistics

    We’ll talk about the component system in detail later. 
    For now, just know that all Vue components are also Vue instances, 
    and so accept the same options object (except for a few root-specific options).
